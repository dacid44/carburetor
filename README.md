## Usage

The current form of this scheme is as a direct patch for [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) ports.

```
mocha = {
  rosewater = "#ffd7d9",
  flamingo = "#ffb3b8",
  pink = "#ff7eb6",
  red = "#fa4d56",
  maroon = "#ff8389",
  peach = "#ff832b",
  yellow = "#fddc69",
  green = "#42be65",
  teal = "#3ddbd9",
  sky = "#82cfff",
  sapphire = "#78a9ff",
  blue = "#4589ff",
  lavender = "#be95ff",
  mauve = "#d4bbff",
  text = "#ffffff",
  subtext1 = "#f4f4f4",
  subtext0 = "#e0e0e0",
  overlay2 = "#c6c6c6",
  overlay1 = "#a8a8a8",
  overlay0 = "#8d8d8d",
  surface2 = "#6f6f6f",
  surface1 = "#525252",
  surface0 = "#393939",
  base = "#262626",
  mantle = "#161616",
  crust = "#000000",
},
```

The [samples](samples) directory contains copy and pasteable patches for different languages. For example, most catppuccin [userstyle](https://github.com/catppuccin/userstyles/) ports use the same exact [css](samples/css.txt) color definition, and are easily modified.
